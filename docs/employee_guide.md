## Frequently Asked Questions

### How often does my calendar update?
Most calendar apps check for updates every 12-24 hours. Your new shifts should appear within a day of the schedule being updated.

### I don't see my shifts - what's wrong?
- Make sure you're using the correct link for YOUR calendar
- Wait 24 hours for the first sync to complete
- Try removing and re-adding the calendar subscription

### Can I edit the shifts in my calendar?
No - this is a subscription calendar, so it's read-only. Only your manager can edit the schedule in the main roster. Changes will sync to your calendar automatically.

### Will this drain my battery?
No - calendar subscriptions use minimal data and battery since they only check for updates occasionally.

### I changed teams - what do I do?
Your manager will provide you with a new calendar link. Remove the old subscription and add the new one.
